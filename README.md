# JSON Typicode challenge

Found this challenge online, how to fetch and work with given data. This is my
take on it, 3 buttons for fetching and one for toggling between table and list
views.

## Install with react app

```sh
npm start
```

### Learned

This has been a nice and very fun reminder how to interact with api and given
data with react.
